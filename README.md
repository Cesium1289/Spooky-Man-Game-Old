# Spooky-Man-Game

## What is this project?
Spooky Man is an engaging game inspired by the original Slender Man, built using the Unity game engine. Players embark on a thrilling adventure in a dark, eerie forest, where their objective is to collect 8 scattered pages while evading the relentless pursuit of Spooky Man. Armed with throwable objects, players must outsmart Spooky Man or outrun him to succeed. Check out this video demo of an earlier build: https://youtu.be/qTZw--nKSII.
